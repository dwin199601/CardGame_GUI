By using Swings we create the card game where the user gets 2 randomly generated cards at the beginning of each round and after user have a choice to get another card by entering 1 or get fold by entering 0 (if fold - balance is the same), to win the game the third car has to be between the first and the second cards (for example if the first and second cards are: "5, heart", "11, spade" and the newly generated card is "6, club", user won). If user won: the balance is + $1, if computer won -$1 (the initial balance is entered by the user at the beginning of the game). The application provides the option to save the result to the file and exit the game. Also, players can play multiple rounds by pressing the "Generate" button. When the save and exit button is pressed, the following information is saved: a number of lost/won rounds, new balance.
